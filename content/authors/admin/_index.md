I am  an incoming Masters student in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. Currently, I am working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [Capillary Technologies](https://www.capillarytech.com/products/smart-store-plus/). As part of the Instore Vision team at Capillary, I have worked on Computer Vision products for extracting useful insights about customers in an offline store, under the guidance of [Subrat Panda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/subratpanda/) and [Sumandeep Banerjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumandeep-banerjee-1436a17/).
Previously I was a Member Technical Staff at [Stride.ai](https://stride.ai/) where I worked on Document Image processing techniques to extract metadata from PDF documents, and Optical Character Recognition for scanned documents, supervised by [Pratheek Mahishi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratheekms/).
