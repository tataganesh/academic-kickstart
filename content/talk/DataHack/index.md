# summary: An example talk using Academic's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "With the advent of Deep Learning and Machine Learning libraries, model prototyping has become very convenient. Consequently, the time taken to build a fairly accurate model has reduced drastically. But the business impact of a model can be observed only after the model is deployed, and thus exposed to real-world data.
Model deployment is a key component in the Machine Learning pipeline. Deploying a model poses several challenges, such as model versioning, containerization of the model, etc. Web frameworks like Flask and Django can be used to wrap the model into a REST API and expose the API. But this solution requires developers to write and maintain code to handle requests to the model and support other deployment-related features as well. \n To tackle this problem, Tensorflow introduced Tensorflow Serving which is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments. The goal of this talk is to give a brief introduction of TensorFlow Serving and illustrate its features using an example use case."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code. -->
